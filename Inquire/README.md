# Inquire

Inquire was not created by imsearch_benchmaker, but it is a dataset we use to benchmark text-to-image retrieval systems in the domain of biology. See the final dataset on Hugging Face [INQUIRE-Benchmark-small on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/sagecontinuum/INQUIRE-Benchmark-small) for a complete dataset description.
